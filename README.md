# Arthropod-proteins-classification

Master final thesis. Deep learning implementation to predict proteins' functionality in insects as an odorant or gustatory receptor.

The developed model will then be applied to non-insect arthropod sequences labeled as gustatory receptors by sequence alignment systems.
